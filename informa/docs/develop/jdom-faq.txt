   What is JDOM?
   
   JDOM is, quite simply, a Java representation of an XML document. JDOM
   provides a way to represent that document for easy and efficient
   reading, manipulation, and writing. It has a straightforward API, is a
   lightweight and fast, and is optimized for the Java programmer. It's
   an alternative to DOM and SAX, although it integrates well with both
   DOM and SAX.


   What is JDOM not?
   
   JDOM is not a wrapper for the W3C's DOM, or another version of DOM.
   JDOM is a Java-based "document object model" for XML files. JDOM
   serves the same purpose as DOM, but is easier to use.
   
   JDOM is not an XML parser, like Xerces or Crimson. It is a document
   object model that uses XML parsers to build documents. JDOM's
   SAXBuilder class for example uses the SAX events generated by an XML
   parser to build a JDOM tree. The default XML parser used by JDOM is
   the JAXP-selected parser, but JDOM can use nearly any parser.


   Is JDOM an acronym?
   
   Nope. Just like JDBC is not officially an acronym, neither is JDOM.
   This ensures we comply with Sun's trademark policies as explained at
   [14]http://www.sun.com/policies/trademarks.


   What is the JDOM license?
   
   JDOM is available under an Apache-style open source license, with the
   acknowledgment clause removed. This license is among the least
   restrictive license available, enabling developers to use JDOM in
   creating new products without requiring them to release their own
   products as open source. This is the license model used by the Apache
   Project, which created the Apache server. The license is available at
   the top of every source file and in LICENSE.txt in the root of the
   distribution, or you can view it using CVSweb at
   [15]http://cvs.jdom.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/jdom/LICENSE.txt.


   Where can I get JDOM?
   
   JDOM is available in binary and source form from
   [16]http://www.jdom.org.


   What is the JDOM Philosophy?
   
   JDOM has been and will continue to be developed with this philosophy:
     * JDOM should be straightforward for Java programmers.
     * JDOM should support easy and efficient document modification.
     * JDOM should hide the complexities of XML wherever possible, while
       remaining true to the XML specification.
     * JDOM should integrate with DOM and SAX.
     * JDOM should be lightweight and fast.
     * JDOM should solve 80% (or more) of Java/XML problems with 20% (or
       less) of the effort


   Why is the JDOM API defined in terms of concrete classes rather than
   interfaces?
   
   This issue has been discussed several times on the JDOM mailing list,
   with several people on both sides. In general, many people feel that a
   class-based API is better when subclassing is not needed, while an
   interface-based API is better when subclassing is needed. However,
   either system can be used in either case.
   
   Jason Hunter summarizes the arguments against an interface-based API
   for JDOM:
   
   With interfaces everything becomes a factory, elements have to be
   'imported' into new documents instead of just added, features like
   long-term serialization cannot be guaranteed, and the list goes on.
   
   We started with interfaces actually. During our pre-release review to
   some peers we received the feedback we should try concrete classes. We
   did, and the design was much better for it.
   
   Think about java.io.File as an analogy. There's a reason we say:
   
File parent = new File(filepath);
File child = new File(parent, "aaa.txt");

   rather than
   
FileSystem fs = FileSystem.getDefaultFileSystem();
File parent = fs.getFile(filepath);
File child = fs.getFile(parent, "aaa.txt");

   The former is simply easier and nicer to deal with.
   
   Another point to keep in mind is that anything that can be done with
   interfaces can be done with subclassing - the only penalty is possibly
   unused variables in the base class.
   
   For reference, the latest mailing list discussion on this topic
   started Nov. 30, 2000 with "Interfaces", and continued with
   "Interface-based JDOM" and "Announce: JDOMPlus". It would help to
   review this discussion before bringing this topic up on the mailing
   list.


   How does JDOM work with DOM and SAX?
   
   JDOM documents can be built from XML files, DOM trees, SAX events, or
   any other source. JDOM documents can be converted to XML files, DOM
   trees, SAX events, or any other destination. This ability proves
   useful, for example, when integrating with a program that expects SAX
   events. JDOM can parse an XML file, let the programmer easily and
   efficiently manipulate the document, then fire SAX events to the
   second program directly - no conversion to a serialized format is
   necessary.


   Was JDOM designed for Java 2?
   
   Yes, JDOM has been designed using the List and Map interfaces from the
   Java 2 Collections API. The Collections API provides JDOM with great
   power and flexibility through standard APIs. We may hear some ranting
   for the next three months about this, but we believe that this is
   better than hearing ranting starting three months from now about why
   we are still using the slow and weak Vector in our code!
   
   I tried to use JDOM and get an error like this:
java.lang.NoSuchMethodError
 or
java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError:
org/xml/sax/SAXNotRecognizedException

   What's wrong? 
   
   You need to ensure that the xerces.jar file supplied with the JDOM
   download is in your classpath before any other XML classes, such as
   those that come with JAXP or Crimson. These other XML libraries, as
   well as older versions of Apache Xerces, support DOM Level 1 and SAX
   1.0, not the required DOM Level 2 and SAX 2.0. The result is an
   exception being thrown. Check your classpath, and try again. If the
   classpath looks OK, the problematic JAR might also be hiding in the
   system's standard extension directory (see the following).


   What do you mean "Standard extension directory"?
   
   The standard extension directory is a directory containing JAR files
   that is searched automatically by the Java runtime and compiler. If
   you've installed the JDK (not the just the JRE) you may well have two
   separate ext directories, one of which is used for compiling
   (typically somewhere like C:\jdk1.3\jre\lib\ext) and the other of
   which is used for running code (typically somewhere like
   C:\Program Files\JavaSoft\jre\1.3\lib\ext). The wrong JAR file in
   either directory can get in your way (though at different times).
   Furthermore, the right JAR file has to be in both directories.


   How do I avoid the DOM Level 1 problem in Visual Age for Java?
   
   When the WTE feature is added to the workspace, the project 'IBM XML
   Parser for Java' is added as well. This project contains old DOM Level
   1 'org.w3c.*' interfaces. JDOM relies on DOM Level 2, and therefore
   conficts with this project. The solution is to do the following:
    1. Change workspace owner to Administrator
    2. Create open edition of the project 'IBM XML Parser for Java'
    3. Delete all the packages that contain org.w3c.* interfaces
    4. Version the project.
    5. Create a new Project for DOM Level 2 parser such as Xerces
    6. Import all Xerces classes including org.w3c.* interfaces (you can
       use a completly different project for those interfaces if you want
       to work with other parsers)
    7. Version the Xerces project
    8. Create a JDOM project and import jdom classes into it. Version the
       project

   How do I avoid the DOM Level 1 problem in WebSphere?
   
   WebSphere has the same issue with DOM Level 1 interfaces as VAJ above.
   The solution is to do one the following:
     * Put the path to xerces.jar (or other DOM Level 2 interfaces) in
       the variable 'com.ibm.ejs.sm.adminserver.classpath' in the file
       admin.config. This resides in $WAS_ROOT$/bin before all other
       variables.
     * or, if you run WAS $WAS_ROOT/bin/debug/adminserver.{bat|sh} add a
       line 'set WAS_CP=xerces.jar' (or other DOM Level 2 interfaces)
       before other set WAS_CP commands.
     * or, add JDOM to the application server CLASSPATH, using either the
       admin.cfg file or the administration console.

   Does JDOM work with JDK 1.1?
   
   Yes. Because JDOM currently has no ties to Java 2 other than the
   Collections APIs, it's possible for someone with JDK 1.1 plus the
   collections.jar (available from
   [17]http://java.sun.com/beans/infobus/#collections) to use JDOM. The
   only "gotcha" is that the collections.jar places the Collections
   classes in com.sun.java.util.collections so you'll need to run the
   special JDOM build scripts build11.bat and build11.sh that trigger an
   import line replace task as part of the build. These scripts are
   available in the current CVS tree and beginning with beta5.


   Are there any performance numbers?
   
   Not yet. JDOM is still really new! Only preliminary numbers have been
   taken, but they have been extremely promising. And JDOM hasn't been
   tuned yet!


   How does JDOM integrate with XSLT?
   
   There are many ways to do XSL transforms with JDOM. The most
   straightforward way is to use the standard JAXP Transformer interface
   and the JDOMSource/JDOMResult classes found in the org.jdom.transform
   package. Look to the sample named XSLTransform for an example
   (jdom/samples). These classes were added after beta6, so you'll want
   to download the latest source from CVS.


   Is there XPath support in JDOM?
   
   XPath on JDOM is being developed by Bob McWhirter and others at
   [18]http://jaxen.org. The implementation is highly functional although
   not quite 100% complete. Bob's experience with implementing XPath on
   JDOM has helped shape and improve the JDOM core, and having XPath
   integration into the core is likely as soon as the implementation is
   complete.


   What features of XML are not fully handled by JDOM?
   
   Eventually we expect the answer to this question to be "None". Our
   goal is to achieve full XML spec compliance while also maintaining an
   API that is easy to learn and use, as well as fast and lightweight. We
   think it's definitely possible, especially with the great feedback and
   ideas from members of the jdom-interest mailing list. Here are the
   current outstanding issues:
   
     * Entities and entity references are an open area of development,
       and we are still experimenting with how Java developers want to
       handle entities while remaining true to the XML specification.
       

   Is JDOM thread safe?
   
   The core API has intentionally been left thread unsafe. In other
   words, there are no synchronized blocks within org.jdom. This decision
   makes sense because we expect the primary JDOM use cases to be:
     * Single thread reads an XML stream into JDOM and looks at it read
       only
     * Single thread reads an XML stream into JDOM and modifies it
     * Single thread reads an XML stream into JDOM and makes it available
       to a run time system for read only access
       
   The use case where a "Single thread reads an XML stream into JDOM and
   exposes it to multiple threads to modify its contents" is fairly rare.
   In that case, JDOM can still be made thread safe but the programmer
   simply has to perform their own synchronization, perhaps as
   synchronizing on the Document instance.


   Why does equals() only do a == check?
   
   In JDOM two objects are only equal if they're the exact same object.
   This lets a call like list.remove(elem) remove only the exact Element
   passed in, not any element that's equivalent. This's a very important
   distinction. Doing a full equals() on an Element would require
   recursing down the tree, and in general we believe it unlikely you'll
   want to know if this element and all its children are equivalent to
   another one. If you really do want to know you can write some
   comparison code yourself that checks only as much as you want to check
   (maybe the name/namespaces only) instead of doing a full recurse.


   Why is equals() declared final?
   
   The equals() methods are final for JDOM classes so that a subclass
   can't break the == behavior that's required for calls like
   list.remove(elem) to work as designed.


   How do I construct a Document from a String?
   
   You use standard Java IO library calls. Wrap the String with a
   StringReader and pass the reader to SAXBuilder:
Document doc = builder.build(new StringReader(xml));


   How do I remove an Element or other content?
   
   Use the methods on the List returned by getChildren() or getContent().
   JDOM doesn't need special methods because the methods already exist in
   List. For example to remove an element from a list of children:
List children = parent.getChildren();
children.remove(element); // given child
children.remove(0);       // first child

   Other methods on List provide options to remove all children, add a
   child at a given location, and so on.


   How do I move an Element from one place to another?
   
   There's no need for node "importing" like there is with DOM. Just
   remove the element from its current place, then add the element to its
   new place. The element's content (including its element children) will
   naturally "tag" along for the ride. You have to remove the element
   before adding it to its new place because elements may have only one
   parent returned by getParent().
newParent.addContent(elt.detach());


   How do I copy an Element from one place to another?
   
   There's no need for node "importing" like there is with DOM. Just
   clone the element being copied and add its clone in its new place. You
   have to clone the element before adding it to its new place because
   elements may have only one parent returned by getParent().
newParent.addContent((Element)elt.clone());


   Can an element or attribute name contain a colon?
   
   The XML 1.0 specification specifically reserves the colon character
   for use with XML Namespaces. No other use is compliant with XML 1.0.
   Therefore JDOM does not allow you to create element and attribute
   names that contain colons except when using namespaces. Furthermore,
   because of the way namespaces are implemented in JDOM, you cannot
   simply create an Element or Attribute with a fully qualified name like
   svg:title. That is you cannot do this:
Element e = new Element("svg:title");

   Instead you must split the two parts into a Namespace and a local
   name. This is the proper JDOM way to create an element in a namespace:
Element e =
  new Element("title", "svg", "http://www.w3.org/2000/svg");

   The first argument is the local name. The second argument is the
   prefix. The third argument is the namespace URI.
   
   The xml:lang and xml:space attributes are special cases that are
   allowed only because the XML 1.0 specification defined them before
   namespaces were current, and therefore a document that is not
   otherwise using namespaces may still want to include these two
   attributes.


   Why do I need to pass in a Namespace to getChild(), when the child
   element I'm looking for has no namespace declaration?
   
   Specifically, for this XML fragment:
<x>
  <y xmlns="http://foo.com">
    <z />
  </y>
</x>

   You need to use code like this:
Namespace ns = Namespace.getNamespace("http://foo.com");
Element y = x.getChild("y", ns);
Element z = y.getChild("z", ns);

   
   If I leave out the namespace from the second call to getChild(), it
   returns null. Why?
   
   JDOM works on the logical in-memory XML tree, not the textual
   representation on-disk. While the element z has no namespace
   declaration, it does have a namespace - the one inherited from its
   parent, which declares a default namespace (associated with the URI
   http://foo.com).
   
   According to the namespaces specification, the following XML fragment
   is identical in meaning to the previous one:
<x>
  <y xmlns="http://foo.com">
    <z xmlns="http://foo.com" />
  </y>
</x>

   The way that the JDOM API handles namespaces means that you can write
   code that works for both examples. Otherwise, you would need to have
   code that checked for each case separately.
   
   Similarly, if you were constructing (instead of reading) the XML in
   the first example above, you would need to write code like this:
Namespace ns = Namespace.getNamespace("http://foo.com");
Element y = new Element("y", ns);
x.addContent(y);
Element z = new Element("z", ns);
y.addContent(z);

   If you left out the Namespace instance from the constructor for the
   element z, you would have the following tree in-memory:
   
<x>
  <y xmlns="http://foo.com">
    <z xmlns="" />
  </y>
</z>


   Why do all new lines appear as \n, even on Windows?
   
   According to section 2.11 of the XML Recommendation, 2nd edition:
   
   To simplify the tasks of applications, an XML processor must normalize
   line breaks in parsed entities to #xA either by translating the
   two-character sequence #xD #xA and any #xD that is not followed by #xA
   to #xA on input before parsing, or by using some other method such
   that the characters passed to the application are the same as if it
   did this translation.
   
   In other words, this is exactly what's supposed to happen.


   Why does setText("&#160;") not do what I want?
   
   When you pass a string into a method like setText() JDOM assumes it's
   just that, a string, not a fragment of XML. For example, when you
   call:
element.setText("&#160;")

   JDOM assumes you want to set the content to the string containing the
   six characters & # 1 6 0 ;. It does not parse it to attempt to
   understand it as XML first. Thus when you output the text using
   XMLOutputter it will naturally escape the special ampersand character
   and output &amp;#160;. The solution is to pass regular Unicode
   characters to the setText() method or, if you have text data that you
   want to be interpreted as XML, pass it through an XML parser before it
   goes into JDOM. This is what the SAXBuilder and DOMBuilder classes do.


   When using an IDE debugger why do I see a strange
   ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException?
   
   Some parsers (Xerces included) use this exception as part of their
   standard operating procedure, internally throwing and catching the
   exception. No code outside the library is meant see it. However, IDE
   debuggers are often configured to report any time this exception is
   thrown, and thus they expose the exception. It can be safely ignored.


   How do I add a PI or Comment before the root element?
   
   You must access the document content as a List. Either get the list
   and add content to its head, or set the list of content explicitly.
doc.getContent().add(0, pi);
or
doc.setContent(listOfContent);


   How do I avoid getting an OutOfMemoryError?
   
   Most JVMs have an option to increase their maximum heap size, which is
   the maximum amount of memory the JVM can use for its objects. In the
   JDK 1.2 you can set your initial heap size to 32 Megs and maximum heap
   size to 64 Megs with the following command:
java -Xms32m -Xmx64m SomeClass

   Of course, if your document is larger than available virtual memory,
   there's not much you can do short of helping us create a
   deferred-build document implementation.


   Why does my file encoding on output not match the encoding on input?
   
   The default character encoding used by XMLOutputter is UTF-8, a
   variable-length encoding that can represent all Unicode characters.
   This can be changed with a call to outputter.setEncoding(). It would
   be nice if XMLOutputter could default to the original encoding for a
   file, but unfortunately parsers don't indicate the original encoding.
   You have to set it programatically.
   
   This issue most often affects people with documents in the common
   ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1) encoding who use characters like ñ but aren't
   familiar with having to think about encodings. The tip to remember is
   that with these documents you must set the output encoding to
   ISO-8859-1, otherwise characters in the range 128-255 will be output
   using a double byte encoding in UTF-8 instead of the normal single
   byte encoding of ISO-8859-1.


   Why does passing a document through a socket sometimes hang the
   parser?
   
   The problem is that several XML parsers close the input stream when
   they read EOF (-1). This is true of Xerces, which is JDOM's default
   parser. It is also true of Crimson. Unfortunately, closing a
   SocketInputStream closes the underlying SocketImpl, setting the file
   descriptor to null. The socket's output stream is useless after this,
   so your application will be unable to send a response. To workaround,
   protect your socket's input stream with an InputStream wrapper that
   doesn't close the underlying stream (override the close() method), or
   read everything into a buffer before handing off to the JDOM builder:
byte[] buf = new byte[length];
new DataInputStream(inputStream).readFully(buf);
InputStream in = new ByteArrayInputStream(buf);

   How do I keep the DTD from loading? Even when I turn off validation
   the parser tries to load the DTD file.
   
   Even when validation is turned off, an XML parser will by default load
   the external DTD file in order to parse the DTD for external entity
   declarations. Xerces has a feature to turn off this behavior named
   "http://apache.org/xml/features/nonvalidating/load-external-dtd" and
   if you know you're using Xerces you can set this feature on the
   builder.
builder.setFeature(
  "http://apache.org/xml/features/nonvalidating/load-external-dtd", false);

   If you're using another parser like Crimson, your best bet is to set
   up an EntityResolver that resolves the DTD without actually reading
   the separate file.
import org.xml.sax.*;
import java.io.*;
public class NoOpEntityResolver implements EntityResolver {
  public InputSource resolveEntity(String publicId, String systemId) {
    return new InputSource(new StringBufferInputStream(""));
  }
}

   Then in the builder...
builder.setEntityResolver(new NoOpEntityResolver());

   There is a downside to this approach. Any entities in the document
   will be resolved to the empty string, and will effectively disappear.
   If your document has entities, you need to setExpandEntities(false)
   code and ensure the EntityResolver only suppresses the DocType.


   How do I validate against a schema when using JDOM?
   
   JDOM doesn't have it's own parser; it uses standard parsers like
   Xerces to do the heavy lifting. If you want schema validation make
   sure you choose a parser that supports schemas. Xerces 2 is a good
   choice (get it from [19]http://xml.apache.org). You also need to use
   code JDOM Beta 8 or later.
   
   To specify the parser JDOM uses, you can either configure JAXP
   appropriately (since JDOM uses JAXP if it's available, see the end of
   this entry for details) or you can explicitly pass the name of the
   parser to the SAXBuilder constructor. For Xerces 2 the parser class is
   org.apache.xerces.parsers.SAXParser. You must also enable parser
   validation by passing "true" when creating a SAXBuilder.
   
   SAXBuilder builder =
     new SAXBuilder("org.apache.xerces.parsers.SAXParser", true);
   
   Next, you tell the parser (Xerces) you want to validate against a
   schema (or schemas), and you pass the parser information about those
   schema. Different parsers do this in different ways. In Xerces you do
   this by setting special 'features' and 'properties' of the parser.
   JDOM exposes these parser settings with the setFeature() and
   setProperty() methods on SAXBuilder. These pass-through methods were
   added after Beta 7, which is why you need Beta 8 or above.
   
   Schemas are enabled by setting the feature
   "http://apache.org/xml/features/validation/schema" to true.
   
   builder.setFeature(
     "http://apache.org/xml/features/validation/schema", true);
   
   Schema locations are given by setting the property
   "http://apache.org/xml/properties/schema/external-schemaLocation" to a
   list of whitespace separated name-value pairs. The 'name' is the
   namespace the schema is associated with, the 'value' is the location
   of the schema for that namespace. For example:
   
   builder.setProperty(
     "http://apache.org/xml/properties/schema/external-schemaLocation",
    "http://www.w3.org/2001/12/soap-envelope soap-envelope.xsd" + " " +
    "http://kevinj.develop.com/weblog/weblog.xsd weblog.xsd");
   
   The above example shows how to validate against multiple schemas --
   against the SOAP 1.2 schema where the namespace is
   http://www.w3.org/2001/12/soap-envelope and the and against a schema
   for namespace http://kevinj.develop.com/weblog/weblog.xsd. The files
   describing these schemas are in soap-envelope.xsd and weblog.xsd
   respectively. You can add as many of these name value pairs as
   necessary. The values themselves are URLs. The name value pairs follow
   the meaning given in the Schema recommendation
   ([20]http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-1/#schema-loc).
   
   The complete code looks like this:
   
   SAXBuilder builder =
     new SAXBuilder("org.apache.xerces.parsers.SAXParser", true);
   builder.setFeature(
     "http://apache.org/xml/features/validation/schema", true);
   builder.setProperty(
     "http://apache.org/xml/properties/schema/external-schemaLocation",
     "http://www.w3.org/2001/12/soap-envelope soap-envelope.xsd" + " " +
     "http://kevinj.develop.com/weblog/weblog.xsd weblog.xsd");
   Document doc = builder.build(xml);
   
   If you want to use JAXP to select the parser, you can skip specifying
   a class to the SAXBuilder constructor and instead set the system
   property "javax.xml.parsers.SAXParserFactory" to the value
   "org.apache.xerces.jaxp.SAXParserFactoryImpl". That tells JAXP to use
   Xerces' factory to build parsers. If you like, you can specify this
   property on the command line:
   
   java -Djavax.xml.parsers.SAXParserFactory=
             org.apache.xerces.jaxp.SAXParserFactoryImpl ...

   How can I perform in-memory validation against a DTD or Schema?
   
   Currently you can't do this, in JDOM or any other Java document object
   model API. However, this is something we'd like JDOM to support, and
   we have a volunteer who's working on it.


   JDOM ensures the document in memory is always well-formed. Can JDOM
   also ensure the document in memory is always valid?
   
   No, it's our current belief that it's better to expose a checkValid()
   type of call than to attempt constant validation checking. One reason
   is performance. A second reason is that you have a chicken-and-egg
   problem where for example an element needs exactly two child elements
   to be valid, but after adding either child the document will be in a
   temporarily invalid state. To work around this would require something
   like transactional modifications, and that's a lot of overhead for
   little gain.


   Why do I get an IndexOutOfBoundsException or
   ConcurrentModificationException on looping?
   
   Code like the following will throw an IndexOutOfBoundsException:
 List children = root.getChildren("foo");
 int size = children.size();
 for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
   Element child = (Element) children.get(i);
   child.detach();
   otherRoot.addContent(child);
 }

   The reason is that the size of the list is pre-calculated but the size
   is reduced by one on each detach() call, causing the for loop to walk
   off the end of the list. The right way to loop is to use an Iterator.
   With an Iterator you don't have this problem, and it's faster as well.
   
   However, even with an Iterator, the following code throws a
   ConcurrentModificationException:
 List children = root.getChildren("foo");
 Iterator itr = children.iterator();
 while (itr.hasNext()) {
   Element child = (Element) itr.next();
   child.detach();
   otherRoot.addContent(child);
 }

   The reason is that the detach() call modifies the list of children at
   the same time the iterator is traversing the list, and that's a
   concurrent modification. The solution is to use the Iterator's
   remove() method instead of detach() in this situation:
 List children = root.getChildren("foo");
 Iterator itr = children.iterator();
 while (itr.hasNext()) {
   Element child = (Element) itr.next();
   itr.remove();
   otherRoot.addContent(child);
 }

   
   Is there an archive for the JDOM mailing lists?
   
   Yes, all the messages are available for your Web-based perusal. Below
   are the slick searchable archives:
     * [21]http://www.servlets.com/archive/servlet/SummarizeList?listName
       =jdom-interest
     * [22]http://www.servlets.com/archive/servlet/SummarizeList?listName
       =jdom-announce
     * [23]http://www.servlets.com/archive/servlet/SummarizeList?listName
       =jdom-commits
       
   There are additional archives at:
     * [24]http://lists.denveronline.net/lists/jdom-interest/
     * [25]http://lists.denveronline.net/lists/jdom-announce/
     * [26]http://lists.denveronline.net/lists/jdom-commits/


   How do I unsubscribe from a mailing list?
   
   The URL to manage your list membership (including subscription) is
   attached at the bottom of every list message. It should be something
   like
   http://lists.denveronline.net/mailman/options/jdom-interest/youraddr@y
   ourhost.com. Make sure to replace "youraddr" with your address and
   "yourhost" with your host. For jdom-announce replace "interest" with
   "announce" in the URL.


   How do I post to the mailing list from multiple addresses?
   
   For spam protection, only members of the mailing list may post. To
   post from multiple accounts, subscribe each account and set the
   "Disable mail delivery" feature to "On" for all the extra accounts.
   You can set that feature at the URL given in the [27]previous answer.


   Should I ask general XML questions to Jason and Brett?
   
   No, they're busy enough already. But you can order Brett's book
   [28]Java and XML or one of the other XML introductory books like
   [29]XML Bible by Elliotte Rusty Harold (one of our prominent
   jdom-interest list members).


   When does JDOM 1.0 come out?
   
   Schedules are difficult to define because all developers are
   volunteers. Jason recently left his day job and has more time now to
   project manage, so things are picking up again after a slow-down in
   the summer and fall of 2001.


   The book Java and XML talks about JDOM 1.0; why the confusion?
   
   The book covers an early beta. Much has changed (for the better) since
   publication of the book. For the most accurate JDOM API trust the
   Javadocs, not the book. Brett was a little optimistic when writing the
   book. His 2nd Edition sets things straight.


   I have a question that isn't answered here. What do I do?
   
   First, you should [30]search the jdom-interest archives. For example,
   if you're using an Oracle parser and see an IllegalTargetException
   that smells fishy, you can search message bodies for "+oracle
   +illegaltargetexception" and you'll find discussion about the issue.
   The plus-signs mean those terms are required to exist in the message
   bodies returned. The searches are powerful and fast!
   
   If you don't find an answer in the archives, you can post to
   jdom-interest. If you think you found a bug, make sure you follow the
   following advice about bug reporting!


   How do I submit a bug report?
   
   If you believe you found a bug in JDOM, please follow this procedure:
    1. Check the [31]TODO.txt file in the root of the distribution to see
       if it's a known issue.
    2. Check if the problem occurs when using the [32]latest daily
       snapshot of JDOM. Odds are good the bug has already been fixed
       since the last beta.
    3. Search the [33]jdom-interest archives as explained above.
    4. If you don't find resolution with the latest snapshot, post to the
       [34]jdom-interest mailing list; make sure you're a subscriber
       first as only subscribers can post.
    5. In the bug report, give as much information as possible -- the
       stack trace, a reproducible and short code example, the XML file
       causing problems. Make sure to state the version of JDOM used
       (which day's snapshot).
    6. If you have a patch to fix the bug, please submit that along with
       the problem report. We love patches.


   Where can I learn more?
   
   JDOM API documentation, slides from the initial JDOM announcement, and
   other helpful resources can all be downloaded [35]here.
