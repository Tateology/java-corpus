     and tests are included anyway)
   - switched from tar.gz to zip compression
   
 o Bringing Maven (1) project build back again for site generation

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.7.0-alpha1

 o Improved parsing of Atom (0.3 and 1.0) feeds (thanks to Nilesh Bansal)
 
 o Migrated to JDK 5 (thanks to Ítalo Borssatto)

 o New PersistenceManager for better integration into the Spring Framework
   see de.nava.informa.utils.manager.hibernate.SpringPersistenceManager

 o Updated 3rd party libraries:
   - JDOM library from b10 to 1.0
   - Lucene from 1.2 to 1.4.3
   - Hibernate from 2.1 to 3.0.5 (and dependent libraries like Jakarta commons)
   - MySQL driver from 3.0.9 to 3.0.17
   - Log4J from 1.2.8 to 1.2.9

 o Removed unecessary 3rd party libraries:
   - XML parsing libraries, since we now assume at least JDK 1.4
   - PostgreSQL JDBC driver (you have to bring it with you on your own)
   - Castor JDO (they were outdated anyway, and the informa Castor JDO 
     binding experimental, the sources are still shipped anyway)

 o Removed xdoclet dependency for generating Hibernate mapping files (hbm)
   from now on we will maintain them manually

 o Removed implementation for the JDO backend, it was not maintained for a
   long time anyway
   
 o Fixed bug 1560571 (Exporting image element for the channel)
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.6.5
 
 o Fixed bug 1145998 (Encoding not correctly set on writing feed)
   Thanks for reporting on this to Felipe Vieira Silva and Filip van Laenen.

 o [adewale@gmail.com, 01-May-2005] Fix for blogs (msdn) which have
   'created' dates, but not 'issued' dates in clear contravention of the Atom
   0.3 spec (Atom 0.3 Parser).

 o Changes by Aleksey Gureev (BlogBridge Team):
   - Added recognition of content type for Atom tags 'title', 'copyright',
     'content' and 'summary'. Title and copyright are returned in plain text.
     Content / summary are preferred in HTML format. Content tag is preferred
     source of entry (item) description.
   - Added support of <content:encoded> tag for RSS1.0 and RSS2.0.
   - Added support of muliple links in entries of Atom feed with different
     types. The one to be put in item object is selected using the order of
     type preference (currently it's set to 'text/html', then 'text/plain',
     then others.
   - Added support for another date format met at http://www.jnsk.se/weblog:
     "Tue, 21 Dec 2004 23:02 +0100".
   - Made poller and cleaner worker threads be daemons.
   - Reverted equals() matching methods to perform minimum comparisons for
     all implementations of ChannelIF and ItemIF (others don't have equals()).
   - Reworked Poller and Cleaner to process tasks basing on simple blocking
     queue, which is significantly more simple and reliable.
   - Added items scanning policies to Poller to control how it looks for the
     new items:
      POLICY_SCAN_ALL            - Scan all items (default)
      POLICY_SKIP_AFTER_EXISTING - Stop scanning once existing item detected.
   - Fixed problems with orphan guide available after successful merging.
   - Added Poller construction method with custom HTTP user-agent.
   - Added support for custom SAX2 Drivers in FeedParser.
   - Reworked session locking in HibernateUtil to improve thread-safety.
   - Added callback interface InputSourceProviderIF to convert feed's
     InputStream before parsing, which is useful for pre-processing the data
     before it gets into parser.
   - Converting case of tags' names to expected before feeds parsing.
   - Poller Module: Channels can be scheduled for polling with initial delay
     different from zero.
   - Poller Module: Added stream providing hook to create non-default
     InputStream for feed fetching.
   - Added detection of Atom 0.1-0.3 to FormaDetector.
   - Fix for invalid TTL format parsing in RSS 2.0.
   - Fix for parsing of Atom feeds without version attribute (v0.3 is assumed).
   - Added support for correct CDATA handling in the fields of Atom feeds
     (title, description, copyright, or whatever).
   - Integrated minor Hibernate + Channel/Item URL's fix by Scott Douglass

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.6.0

 o upgraded CGLib to 2.0.2 (full)

 o Changes by Aleksey Gureev (BlogBridge Team):
   - Added universal Persistence Management interface. At the present moment
     interface supports operations over ChannelGroup's, Channel's and Item's.
   - Added In-Memory and Hibernate persistence manager implementations.
   - Added Poller module for convenient multi-threaded background polling of
     changes in channels.
   - Added Cleaner module for convenient multi-threaded background cleaning
     of channels using the set of rules.
   - Changed the way two URL's compared in implementations of ChannelIF and
     ItemIF to perform better and unleash the power of multi-threaded
     environment.

 o Fixed feature request 1015930 (long channelId vs. int channelId:
   ChannelRegistry)
 
 o Fixed feature request 1015926 (Issue Tracking link is bad)


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.5.5

 o first experimental support for reading in Atom syntax (0.3 spec)
 
 o renamed de.nava.informa.parsers.RSSParser 
   to de.nava.informa.parsers.FeedParser to express that we
   will be able to read in RSS and Atom news feeds
   (the associated test class is also renamed)

 o Improved FeedManager: the refresh daemon makes now use of cache settings

 o fixed Bug 934766 (RSS2 parser fails if namespace declared)

 o added exporter for RSS 2.0 format
   (see class de.nava.informa.exporters.RSS_2_0_Exporter)

 o Refreshed library dependencies:
   - upgraded to JDOM b10
   - upgraded MySQL JDBC driver 3.0.9
   - upgraded JUnit to 3.8.1

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.5.0

 o Changes by Michael Harhen:
   - Modified Channel to use a Jakarta Commons 3.0 LinkedMap if it is available.
     Otherwise use a LinkedHashMap for JDK 1.4+, and a HashMap for
     earlier versions. This provides full equivalence for all JDK versions.
   - Added getName() / setName() methods to WithNameMIF interface.
   
 o Pito
   - added moveChannelTo, deleteChannel, deleteItemFromChannel, hasChannel methods to PersistChanGrp class
   - fixed several very tricky bugs in hibernate support (relating to .equals handling)
   - added many new JUNit tests to verify hibernate support
   - added handy rssUrlTestData class to help with writing JUnit tests (provides a bunch of usable rss urls)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.4.5 (November 9, 2003)

 o added guard for checking that channel element is found when parsing RSS
   feeds.

 o Pito
   - added test/src/de/nava/informa/impl/hibernate/TestInformaPersistence
   - Continued to make hibernate support more robust
   - Added new PersistChanGrpMgr + PersistChanGrpMgrTask
   - Added InformUtils class with misc utility functions
   - Added TestPersistentChannelGroup (not yet a JUnit case)
   - Corrected duplicate LOCATION and LOCSTRING fields in Hibernate Schema
   - Added ability to supply a Property object to Hibernate for a final set of defaults
   - Added some more notification options to PersistChanGrpMgr
   - Added a new test for PersistChanGrpMgr and PersistChanGrpTask
   - Integrate Hibernate 2.1

 o added id fields to ImageIF and TextInputIF

 o updated PostgreSQL JDBC driver (to 7.3.2)

 o Changes by Michael Harhen:
   - Added elements to ChannelIF: Rating, Generator, Docs, Ttl and Cloud
   - Added elements to ItemIF: GUID, Comments, Source, and Enclosure
   - Added detection of RSS 0.94 (uses RSS 2.0 parser)
   - Added "link" attribute to ImageIF
   - Added "name" attribute to TextInputIF
   - Fixed bugs in RSS_1_0_Parser.java - incorrect namespace for copyright,
     image description. Added better detection of various elements - comments,
     pubDate, lastBuildDate.
   - Fixed bug and simplified getNamespace(Element element, String prefix)
     in ParserUtils
   - Added methods to ChannelIF and ItemIF to retrieve arbitrary elements
     and attributes.
   - Modified Channel to use a LinkedHashMap for JDK 1.4+, and a HashMap for
     earlier versions. This restores compatibility with JDK 1.3.
   - Modified RSS_2_0_Parser, there is now a separate GUID element, so do
     not treat "guid" as equivalent to "link".

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.4.0 (September 29, 2003)

 o first implementation of OPML Parser (currently only version 1.1 is
   supported)

 o added ChannelIF to ChannelBuilderIF.createItem()

 o impl.Channel now uses LinkedHashMap for storing news items,
   this allows to keep original order of items (thanks to Michael Rex)

 o renamed AbstractParser into AbstractChannelParser

 o Sam added his FeedManager (under de.nava.informa.utils)

 o substantial simplifying parsing by removing:
   ChannelParserIF, ChannelParserCollection
   FeedParserIF, AbstractParser, AbstractChannelParser

   OLD:
    ChannelParserIF parser = new RSS_2_0_Parser(inpFile);
    parser.setBuilder(channelBuilder);
    ChannelIF channel = parser.parse();

   NEW:
    ChannelIF channel = RSSParser.parse(channelBuilder, inpFile);

 o first release of the hibernate backend
   (see tests under de.nava.informa.impl.hibernate for usage)


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.3.0 (July 28, 2003)

 o Fixed some bugs:
   [719185] Exporters do not write Date for items
   [724432] UpdateChannelTask not catching RunTimeException
   [736257] copyChannelProperties does not copy the Image
   [719175] Comment after XML Header seems to break FormatDetector
   [755358] NullPointerException when parsing RSS 0.9 file
   [730833] Remove "<" and ">" in stringifications
   [743318] ChannelFormat not Serializable
   [771138] Problem with build - missing log4j.properties file

 o added de.nava.informa.parsers.AbstractParser to be able to clean
   the parser implementations (RSS 0.91, 1.0 and 2.0), this fixes also
   a bug reported by Sam in case no channel builder was set

 o added comparison for channels (Thanks to Jonathan Krebs)
   see de.nava.informa.utils.ChannelComparator

 o added support in the RSS 1.0 exporter and parser for the Syndication
   module (Thanks to Jonathan Krebs)

 o switched logging mechanism used for Informa library to be compliant with
   Apache Commons Logging, since this makes it easier to plug-in JDK 1.4
   logging besides Log4J

 o upgraded to JDOM b9 (was b8)

 o ChannelParserIF#parse() throws now also IOException if something
   bad happens with the source from which the channel is read in

 o same applies to FormatDetector#getFormat(URL), throws now also
   in addition IOException, instead of transforming into RuntimeException

 o removed ChannelIF#copyProperties(ChannelIF) this method was not
   at the right place and is now there where it belongs in UpdateChannelTask

 o restructuring of the ChannelBuilder classes:
   - new methods: ChannelBuilderIF#init(Properties) and #close()
   - introducing ChannelBuilderException
   - renaming method names from make...() to create...()

 o added subject support in RSS_2_0_Parser (thanks to Sergio Umlauf)

 o renamed package de.nava.informa.impl.jdo to de.nava.informa.castorjdo
   to make more clear that this backend relies on the Exolab Castor JDO


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.2.6 (April 6, 2003)

 o improved date parsing again, by giving the timezone more respect
   (fixing also bug 714831)

 o When parsing a RSS 1.0 channel the item description element tries
   to use the default namespace, if not available it falls back to the
   'dc' namespace (this fixes bug 714835)

 o Better handling of unset news item links in the RSS_1_0_Exporter
   (bug report 715523)

 o added test case for importing a channel defintion according to the
   RSS/RDF 1.0 syntax

 o integrated the more lazy channel parsing approach from Pito which
   does not parse right in the same moment as the channel is being
   added to the channel registry

 o fixed mapping.xml (only relevant to the JDO implementation)
   * changed element xml to bind-xml (now validates again)
   * added link mapping information to item (fixes bug 707159)

 o (finally) added log4j.properties (automatically loaded by the
   classloader, if available in the classpath)

 o improved ChannelFormat (was mis-use of an interface before) so
   instead of an integer there is now an own type for the channel
   format

 o changed interface ChannelParserIF to be more flexible (was only
   allowing a URL to be passed), now up to the constructor, for
   example:
   OLD:
     ChannelParserIF parser = new RSS_0_91_Parser(new ChannelBuilder());
     channel = parser.parse(inpFile.toURL());
   NEW: (instead of a new ChannelBuilder instance, this should be shared)
     ChannelParserIF parser = new RSS_0_91_Parser(inpFile);
     parser.setBuilder(new ChannelBuilder());
     channel = parser.parse();


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.2.4 (January 20, 2003)

 o Refactored utility methods out of RSS Parsers into
   utils.ParserUtils, also improved parsing of dates

 o ItemComparator allows now to distinguish between found and
   retrieved date to be used by sorter

 o Core interface adjustments:
   ~ refactored attribute subscription from Channel[IF] to a
     collection of channel subscriptions in UserIF
   ~ refactored attribute metadata from Item[IF] to a collection of
     item metadata objects in UserIF
   ~ added attribute channel to ChannelSubscription[IF] (navigability)
   ~ added attribute item to ItemMetadata[IF] (navigability)
   ~ removed attribute channelGroup from Channel[IF] to allow separate
     channel grouping per user
   ~ applied composite pattern to ChannelGroup[IF] so that channel
     groups are allowed to be nested
   ~ added attributes pubDate and lastBuildDate to Channel[IF]
   ~ added attribute title to ChannelGroup[IF]


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.2.2 (October 20, 2002)

 o Added RSS/RDF 1.0 export

 o A Channel[IF] can now be assigned a *collection* of CategoryIF objects

 o Removed obsolete interface ChannelCollectionIF (and basic implementation)

 o moved Castor JDO mapping and database configuration file into
   src/de/nava/informa/impl/jdo (was: test/jdo)

 o moved database schema creation script into own 'sql' directory


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.2.1 (August 21, 2002)

 o Summary: Added more JavaDoc to the sources

 o create a very basic web site explaining the project and basic
   usage (started a FAQ)

 o improved a bit the JavaDoc of:
   - impl.basic.IdGenerator
   - utils.FormatDetector
   - utils.SimpleChannelObserver

 o switched from protected member fields to private in general

 o create package.html inside all of the source package directories

 o write script to add docs/header to all of the java source files


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.2.0 (August 5, 2002)

 o Summary: Initial (alpha) release

 o build a category tree in minigui, containing the individual channels

 o fixed update problem in minigui, added method channelRetrieved in
   ChannelObserverIF and impls

 o how to persist channel and item information?
   - using Castor JDO (first implementation is now finished, 21-July-2002)
   (alternatives, not chosen for this library)
   ~ use Torque (similar to Castor, less cache features)
   ~ try to figure out wether jdom-contrib-beans-BeanMapper could be used
   ~ consider using Jakarta Betwixt
     http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/betwixt
   ~ write custom JDOM code

 o JDO implementation: second class objects get id member not in
   interface but only in JDO implementation, because it is not needed
   anywhere else

 o new IdGenerator concept / interface which all implemenation use
   consistently (impl.basic does not care about Ids)

 o renamed ChannelCollection[IF] to ChannelGroup[IF]

 o ChannelExporterIF and RSS 0.91 Exporter class in place

 o integrating lucene for searching/filtering through Items

 o try to avoid Lucene specific parameters in public methods in
   informa.search classes to be a bit more independent

 o re-indexing (or updating the index) if new item was added by
   using the following code:
   writer = new IndexWriter(_path, _analyzer, false)
   writer.addDocument(_new_item)
   writer.optimize();
   writer.close();

 o add to the Lucene Item Document a new field with the parent
   channel location (non indexed field)

 o improve fault tolerance of lucene indexing if fields are not set
   -> ItemDocument class

 o added implementation of ChannelCollectionIF

 o renamed ItemFields into ItemFieldConstants in package
   de.nava.informa.search

 o added member ID to ChannelIF and implementation

 o created ItemSubscriptionIF for storing client metadata (read flag
   and score)

 o add to ItemIF method (and implement)
   ChannelIF getChannel();

 o avoid reading DTD (that is done, even when explictly unset validation)
   (see jdom-faq.txt)
   -> de.nava.informa.utils.NoOpEntityResolver

 o migrate ItemComparator from test/minigui.py into own java utility class

 o integrate Log4J, throw away all printing to stdout and stderr

 o think about moving ChannelRegistry from utils package to impl.basic
   and create also an interface for it (no, it is too tight bound to
   other classes from the utils package, also only the Map of channels
   is interesting to persist).

 o implement utils.UpdateChannelTask

 o implement utils.FormatDetector
   -> improve by using version attribute

 o start write some test cases

 o start implementing the Event - Listener mechanism
   (using the Observer pattern)
